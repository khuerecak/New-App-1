    <p><br>
      There has never been a better time to be a creative person. With today&#39;s technology, it is so easy to showcase
      work to people all over the world. The technology we have access to allows us to showcase anything we make, with
      anyone, from the comfort of wherever we wish to be. Viewers then can experience an artist&#39;s product from the
      comfort of wherever they wish to be.<br><br>
      The challenge in this lies in the organization of the production of work. It&#39;s easy to take progress pictures of
      anything. It is not so easy to keep them organized and separate from all the other pictures we take on our mobile
      devices every day. What&#39;s even harder is turning progress pictures or documentation into something that can be
      shared online.<br><br>
      This is what has led me to begin the process of developing a mobile application that allows creators of all
      mediums to document their processes and keep their documentation in a single place, separate from everything else
      they do. This same app will then give creators the capabilities to easily turn their documentation into shareable
      content that can be publish in different formats onto any social media platforms. Users will be able to take
      pictures and videos from within the app. These pictures and videos can be turned into collages, timelapses, short
      documentaries, and then be posted onto platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Users will be able to document
      their processes like never before. They can then share their documentation with others in the most simple and
      effective manner.<br><br>
      The app is geared towards visual creators such as painters, bakers, sculptors, designers, photographers, etc.
      Still, anyone who wants to document any type of process will be able to benefit from this app. There currently
      isn&#39;t an app on the market that does what this app would do once it is complete. There are many apps for sharing
      work and then there are apps for editing work, but I haven&#39;t found an app that focuses on process documentation.
      I have attached some images of the app to this document. I will usual these visuals to explain the features and
      functionality of the app. There will be many more pages once the app is complete. These images just highlight some
      of the main features and tools that users will be able to utilize.
